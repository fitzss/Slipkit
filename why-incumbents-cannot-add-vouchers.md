# Why Incumbents Cannot Simply “Add Vouchers”… and Why Slipkit Can

---

### The 30-second takeaway
Slipkit’s bearer slips look trivial: lock collateral, mint a code, hand it over.  
Card networks, super-apps, and remittance giants cannot copy that flow without ripping out their own rules, revenue, and ledgers. Slipkit on ChainCash has no such baggage.

### Where the giants get stuck

| Incumbent | Regulation wall | Revenue wall | Tech wall |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Visa / Mastercard** | Must KYC every cardholder and merchant | Live on per-swipe interchange; one slip > ten fees | Central ledger, no spend-once notes |
| **PayPal / Venmo** | Money-service rules tie value to accounts | Earn float + per-tx fees, slips bypass both | Closed SQL balances; users never hold funds directly |
| **Western Union / MoneyGram** | Must ID sender & receiver in every corridor | 5–10% per send disappears if slips cross borders free | Hub-and-spoke nightly reconciliation |
| **Stripe / Square** | Underwrite every merchant as facilitator | Per-transaction margin evaporates when slips circulate | APIs settle to cards or ACH, not on-chain burns |
| **Wise / Revolut** | E-money licences require full identity ledger | FX spread and subscriptions vanish on bulk redemption | Multicurrency cores assume batch net-settlement |
| **M-Pesa / Airtel Money** | SIM-linked IDs and logs at every hop | Cash-in/out and P2P fees disappear off-ledger | USSD/SMS databases, no smart-contract engine |

### Three walls they cannot climb

1. **Licensing**  
   Their charters hard-code custody and KYC. Bearer notes break those terms.

2. **Revenue**  
   They bill per account or per swipe. A slip that trades ten times pays only once.

3. **Architecture**  
   Pipeline ledgers store balances at the centre. Slipkit stores value in the note.

These walls define the classic innovator’s dilemma: incumbents see the opportunity but cannot chase it without gutting what pays the bills.

### Why Slipkit sails past the walls

* **Licence-light** — collateral lives in a ChainCash reserve box, not on a money-transmitter ledger.  
* **Fee-light** — protocol takes a tiny cut at mint or redeem, not on every hop.  
* **Code-ready** — AVL trees already track burned note IDs; spend-once logic is native.

That lets builders launch offline P2P slips, GAU- or rsBTC-backed notes, yield-bearing LP slips, local credits — any asset you can collateralise and sign.
